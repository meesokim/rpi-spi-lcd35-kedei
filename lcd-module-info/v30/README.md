# v3

I don't own this version LCD so I don't have any photos.
But it is not compatibile from previous "drivers" . In `src` is "driver" (a kernel + compiled modules) for v3 (untested but I copied this from kedei baidu directory).

If somebody get diff or ili9353.c file the please share with me I will attach it to src .
