# v2.0
I have bought this one as "broken". The seller was certaint that only the digitizer is cracked but LCD got crack too :sad: . Photos shows lcd connected to RPi2 with running kernel for v1 (so the colors are mixed/inverted/etc).

There is one change to the circuit, RP resistor array (27 ohm) for backlight leds as I pressume - in v1 got warm after a while because white leds have Vf about 3.15 to 3.25V ,but votalge regulator is giving 3.3-3.4V so the current going throught backlight white LEDs is too big...
