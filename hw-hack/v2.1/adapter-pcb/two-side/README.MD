# Two-side pcb deisgn files
This directory contains two-side pcb design files.
I have changed to single-size: raster on pads with signals, and of course no extra wires/jumpers to be soldered. Expect selecting 16bit on JP1.

I'm going to send those design files for manufacturing a prototypes... I will post update whit results when I built this circuit.
